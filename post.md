> **This post is meant planned to be published March 2, with the official annoucement of AirPair's new authoring tools. Feedback most welcome.**

## 1. `mkdir` cat-brace-pencil-mutant

TODO *Insert funny pic of octocat with airpair brace and pencil*

### 1.1 `touch` TLDR;annoucement

Today I'm excited to annouce one of the coolest and innovative projects I've ever been involed with. Pretty much anything part git or Octocat is already going to be cool. If you've enjoyed reading the AirPair blog before now, it gives me great pleasure to let you know how much more awesome it's going to be from today onwards with the launch of our new Git Powered Collaborative Publishing workflow.

I'll intertwine quite a few reasons why these tools are significant, while covering why we buitd this platform, how we put the it together and what types of things we hope to see. Before going into detail, perhaps much of the value of these tools can be summed up in this screenshot:

With the power of forking, we can tackle some age old scenarios with far less friction.

- Annoyed with that typo? *Fixed*. 
- Code sample has a syntax error? *Fixed*.
- Sample no longer runs with new framework version? *Fixed*.
- Better way to do something? *Make it better*

### 1.2 `touch` README.md

** Table of contents **

If you haven't already read my mind (after all we built this to get one step closer to singularity), I want reaffirm that we believe this idea is significant, so in *Part 2* I will cover why developers need a git powered blogging system like this. In *Part 3* I will explain how the technicalities of how we put it together and what the flow looks like. In *Part 4* I'm going to leave off on the philosophical direction we're seeking, how you can be invovled in coming with us on the journey.

### 1.3 What's in it for you?



#### For Readers

#### For Authors

### 1.4 Help us make this work

### 2.1 `touch` When Ideas Have Sex

## 1. The begining, middle, adorable abomonation & his baby

### 2.2 `touch` Making our content effort self sustainable

#### 2.2.1 Reducing content half life

But the principals remain valid

#### Empowering people to help authors

#### Motivating more content

To riff of Github 'Social coding', 'Social Blogging' is a much deeper and social way to collaborate and share knowledge through this medium

##### Making it easier to write

##### Providing more reasons to write

- Audience
- Learning to be a better writer
- Having people you respect engage with your work

can help you maintain your post as versions change

### 2.2 `touch` making-our-content-plaform-self-sustainable

With a complete git backed history
And acknowledgement of contributors

 But to start, let me explain the white space in between the extreme long tail *Stackoverflow* sparked our imaginations, when everyone realized how neccessarily a consolidated resources of extreme long tail knowledge was. On the other end of the spectrum, PluralSight, 

Yes, people have published and translated books on github. Git is almost every developers favorite tool... but it was Github who took the tool and combined beautiful product and execeptional community building to make something, somewhere in-between technology and common conciousness, to bring about the next level of cognitive collaboration. Wow, the day I understood that you could work with someone without having met them, or even know thei name - I knew Github was my favorite startup.

## How AirPair's Publishing Tools Were Built

### Our Publishing Flow

This is our first go at gluing the two systems together, so we might not have reached the optimal solution, and we'll probably learn a lot in the coming weeks.

### Draft => In Review => Published


```javascript,linenums=true
//Code blocks for javascript
function() {
  var coolness = true
}
```

## 4. `mkdir` where-to-from-here ?

### Building AirPair's Blogging Community

### Partnering with Technology and API providers

## 5. `mkdir` conclusion

We hope this project is as impactful and we think can be and that news of these tools travel through the developer world. At AirPair we wake each day focused on how we can make a thriving company around the core values of enabling knowledge to transfer more easily from one mind to the next. We're looking for amazing, top notch engineers who want to build and market new ideas like this. Drop us a line if you'd like to work on things like this.
