## 1 Filling a gap with Social Authoring

Thanks to StackOverflow's *Social Q&A* platform, we have a reliable,
universal go-to for ***long tail*** software knowledge. On the **short**
end of the spectrum, docs by Open Source creators and API companies provide
excellent answers for most queries like "AngularJS Directive". 

But what about questions in between, like "How to Build a mobile chat
system with Firebase" or "Should I use AngularJS or Ember"? Independent
posts scattered across the web are our best tool for ***medium tail***
queries like these. Unfortunately, unless you recognize the author, it can
be hard to tell a post is the best piece on a given subject matter.
Furthermore, software knowledge moves so fast... you will usually only find
out after sinking your teeth in, that content is out of date and no longer
relevant.

Writing high quality long form technical content is hard. Itâ€™s even harder
to maintain. Yet there's a growing necessity to cover more permutations of
medium tail queries with better tutorials, examples of technology in
production and opinion pieces. The Social thing seemed to work for
Stackoverflow on Q&A and GitHub on coding. Can we collaborate to step
things up a notch with authoring too?
