> *** Author's Request: This post is planned to be published March 2nd, with the official annoucement of our new Github powered authoring tools. We're going to let the new features run for a couple of weeks for feedback. We'd love to hear what you think and we'd also love your help spreading the word on social media first week of March, and please not before then :). Feel free to fork this post and make suggestions via Pull Request too.***

## 1. `mkdir` cat-brace-pencil-mutant

TODO *Insert funny pic of octocat with airpair brace and pencil*

### 1.1 `touch` TLDR;annoucement

Today I'm excited to annouce one of the coolest and innovative projects I've ever been involed with. Pretty much anything part git or Octocat is already going to be cool. But if you've enjoyed the AirPair blog before already, it gives me great pleasure to let you know how much more awesome it's going to get. From today onwards you're invited both as author or reader to contribute to our blog with our new *Github Powered Collaborative Publishing Workflow*.

I'll intertwine many reasons why these tools are significant, while covering why we built them, how we put the the flow together and what types of things we hope to see. Before diving into detail, perhaps much of the value can be summed up in this screenshot and a few uses cases:

- Annoyed with that typo? ***Fork and Fix***. 
- Code sample has a syntax error? ***Fork and Fix***. 
- Sample no longer runs with new framework version? ***Fork and maintian***. 
- Better way to do something? ***Fork and suggest enhancement***. 

### 1.2 `touch` README.md

** In this post (Table of contents) **

I'm going to finish of **Section 1** with a few main points in case you want to come back to read the read of the post later. If you haven't already read my mind (after all, we built this to get one step closer to singularity), in **Section 2** I'm going to cover when ideas have sex, why developers need a git powered blogging system and drive home why we think this is a big deal. In *Section 3* I will explain how the technicalities of how we put it together and what the flow looks like. In **Section 4** I'm going to round things off on the philosophical direction we're seeking, cover how you can be invovled in coming with us on the journey. Finally **Section 5** will summarise what's been said in a cohesive conclusion.

### 1.3 `touch` What's in it for you?

Here's a list of things we think are bleeding edge wins. Read this whole post to explore how and why. They are merely listed in this section.

#### For Readers

- More comprehensive and up to date content than ever before.
- The ability to contribute even if only being an expert in on a small nugget of subject matter.
- Lower bar to entry to interact with thought leaders who author.
- Clear signals that a post is worth reading by who it has been endorsed by.

#### For Authors

- Expontential help from readers taking your work from 9/10 to 10/10 quality.
- An *MVP* like forum to introduce new ideas and attract peers that can help evolve them before released to the public.
- Exposure to significantly more readers than publishing on your own blog.
- Recognition and personal branding for great work, even when no one has heard of your before.

### 1.4 `git commit "Intro to AirPairs new Developer Blogging Tools" -m` :

I hope you're excited as we are and you find time to read the rest of this post now, or another time. You can use AirPair's bookmark feature to collect content on AirPair that you'd like to revisit.

We're excited to make this work, but community is only part technology. That's one of the things we care about at AirPair, all the nodes and connections that make up real thriving community. We hope that this becomes another way the developer world makes not only the evolution of knowledge, but experiences each other on a personal level for plain old simple human connection. Now's the perfect time to become part of this, by help us get things off to a great start by sharing on social media (assuming you're reading this from March 2 onwards!).

git add .
git commit -m ''

## 2. `mkdir` why-build-a-git-powered-workflow ?

### 2.1 `touch` When Ideas Have Sex

## 1. The begining, middle, adorable abomonation & his baby

### 2.2 `touch` Making our content effort self sustainable

#### 2.2.1 Reducing content half life

But the principals remain valid

#### Empowering people to help authors

#### Motivating more content

##### Social Blogging

To riff of Github 'Social coding', 'Social Blogging' is a much deeper and social way to collaborate and share knowledge through this medium

##### Making it easier to write

##### Providing more reasons to write

- Audience
- Learning to be a better writer
- Having people you respect engage with your work

can help you maintain your post as versions change

### 2.2 `touch` making-our-content-plaform-self-sustainable

With a complete git backed history
And acknowledgement of contributors

 But to start, let me explain the white space in between the extreme long tail *Stackoverflow* sparked our imaginations, when everyone realized how neccessarily a consolidated resources of extreme long tail knowledge was. On the other end of the spectrum, PluralSight, 

Yes, people have published and translated books on github. Git is almost every developers favorite tool... but it was Github who took the tool and combined beautiful product and execeptional community building to make something, somewhere in-between technology and common conciousness, to bring about the next level of cognitive collaboration. Wow, the day I understood that you could work with someone without having met them, or even know thei name - I knew Github was my favorite startup.

## How AirPair's Publishing Tools Were Built

### Our Publishing Flow

This is our first go at gluing the two systems together, so we might not have reached the optimal solution, and we'll probably learn a lot in the coming weeks.

### Draft => In Review => Published


```javascript,linenums=true
//Code blocks for javascript
function() {
  var coolness = true
}
```

## 4. `mkdir` where-to-from-here ?

### Building AirPair's Blogging Community

### Partnering with Technology and API providers

## 5. `mkdir` conclusion

We hope this project is as impactful and we think can be and that news of these tools travel through the developer world. At AirPair we wake each day focused on how we can make a thriving company around the core values of enabling knowledge to transfer more easily from one mind to the next. We're looking for amazing, top notch engineers who want to build and market new ideas like this. Drop us a line if you'd like to work on things like this.
