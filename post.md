## 1 Filling a gap with Social Authoring

Thanks to StackOverflow's *Social Q&A* platform, we have a reliable,
universal go-to for ***long tail*** software knowledge. On the **short**
end of the spectrum, docs by Open Source creators and API companies
provide excellent answers for most queries like "AngularJS Directive". 

But what about questions in between, like "How to Build a mobile chat
system with Firebase" or "Should I use AngularJS or Ember"? Independent
posts scattered across the web are our best tools for answering ***medium
tail*** queries like these. Unfortunately, unless you recognize an
author, it can be hard to if you're about to read the best or even a good
enough piece on a given subject matter.

Writing high quality long form technical content is hard. Itâ€™s even harder
to maintain. Yet there's a growing necessity to cover more permutations of
medium tail queries with better tutorials, examples of technology in
production and expert opinion pieces. The Social thing seemed to work for
Q&A on Stackoverflow and coding on GitHub. Can we step authoring up a
notch with some social magic too?

### 1.1 Announcing Social Authoring on AirPair

Pretty much anything part Git, or Octocat related is going to be cool. If
you've already enjoyed AirPair's posts section, it gives me great
pleasure knowing that from today our community content is about to get
way more awesome. Join our ***Social Authoring*** experiment as an author
publishing your own posts, or reviewer contributing to posts by others
using **Forks and Pull Requests**.

With our new *GitHub Powered Workflow*, we hope to usher collaboration
that will enable more accurate and refined technical writing than ever
before. In this post, I'll cover how we integrated GitHub intertwined
with many cool opportunities that make our new authoring setup
significant. We'll end leading into our ***$100,000 Developer Writing
Competition***, but before diving into details, here's a screenshot to
get you thinking:
